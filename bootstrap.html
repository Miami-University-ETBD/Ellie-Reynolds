            Hi! I’m Ellie Reynolds, a student at Miami University, planning to graduate in 2028, and pursuing a degree
            in Sport Communication and Media with a focus on sport photography.
            Sports have always been at the heart in both my life and my family’s. Growing up in a college town, Miami
            University, and near Cincinnati, home to our favorite professional teams like the Reds and Bengals, I had
            countless opportunities to attend games and experience the excitement of live sports. On top of that, my
            parents ensured that my four siblings and I were always involved in sports year-round, with my dad coaching
            many of our teams. It’s hard to imagine my life without them. Sports have not only provided unforgettable
            experiences and opportunities to travel to new places, but they’ve also taught me valuable life lessons and,
            most importantly, allowed me and my family to build meaningful connections with people along the way.
            From a young age, I’ve been drawn to the media side of sports—whether it was closely paying attention to the
            video boards at games or noticing the camera crews on the sidelines. It’s something that Has always stood
            out to me. I’ve been fascinated by how the media portrays sports, the creativity and art behind it, and how
            it can make you feel. This passion is what led me to pursue a degree in Sport Communication and Media. More
            specifically, in photography, I’m passionate about capturing perspectives and emotions that go beyond what
            meets the eye as a spectator in the stands.
