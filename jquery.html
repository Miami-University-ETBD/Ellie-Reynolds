            <button>Why Sports Photography?</button>


            <p>I grew up in a family where sports were everything — playing them, talking about them, and watching them
                was just part of everyday life. Naturally, sports became the heartbeat of who I am. As I got older, I
                began to see the deeper lessons behind the game — the stories, the emotion, the connections. That’s what
                drew me to sports photography. It gives me the chance to freeze those powerful moments in time and use
                my creative eye to show others that sports are about so much more than just the game.</p>
            <p>I have experience at the high school and collegiate level. As well as in portrait and event photography!
